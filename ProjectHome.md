The idea of a bloated IRC bot, spawned from the twisted minds by a group of students who began studying at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola, LTH, in 2008 in the class d10. This group now recides at irc.quakenet.org in #d10.

To compile the project you will need to download this file, also available in the download section, and add it as an external JAR-file: http://www.jibble.org/files/pircbot-1.4.6.zip. If you get the project-files from the _SVN_, you will automatically get the this file, found in the "project-folder"/lib-directory.
